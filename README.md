# Sentiment Analysis with Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on text data using Python's `scikit-learn` library. The sentiment of each text entry is classified into three categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**. The project reads a CSV file containing text data and labels, trains a machine learning model, and saves the predictions to a new CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library for handling the data.
- `scikit-learn` library for machine learning tasks.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas
